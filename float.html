    <p class="p1">Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.</p>
    <p class="p2">We are constantly expanding this tool by adding specific random picture categories. These categories are geared to a specific topic with only photos of that topic. For example, if you wanted to see random dogs, you would go to the category dropdown and choose "dogs" and then all the random pictures would be of random dogs. If you have a particular category you would like to see us create, feel free to contact us. We hope to one day have hundreds of specific random categories for you to choose from and it's helpful to know which categories you'd like to see.</p>
    <p class="p3">For these reasons, it's much more secure to have a random password generated even though it might be a bit more difficult to remember. If you find it easier to remember certain special characters over others, then you can select to only have those placed in the random password which should make it a bit easier to remember. The key is to understand that if you opt to use common tricks to help you remember your password over generating a random password, you're going to end up with one that is less secure.</p>
