            <td class="col1">It happens to us all. You wake up and you're hungry but you're just not in the mood for the breakfast you've had the past week. You want something different, but as you look in your refrigerator and cupboards, there doesn't seem to be anything that's appealing. You want something new but you have no idea what that new is. By looking at pictures of different breakfast ideas, you're sure to come across a bunch of new ideas that you have never before considered. Hopefully, a few of those will sound appealing and you have been inspired to try something new for breakfast. It's also great to look through all the random breakfast ideas the night before so you can be inspired and choose your breakfast for the next morning.</td>
            <td class="col2">Another benefit of never being sure which Bible verse is going to appear is the random generator gives you the opportunity to read Bible verses you may have forgotten or not thought thoroughly about. While you likely have your favorite parts of the Bible, having Bible verses appear at random can help you find appreciation for other parts of the Bible you don't spend as much time reading. This can be a wonderful way to expand your love of the Bible.</td>
            <td class="col3">This free Bible tool can be an excellent way for you to test your Bible knowledge, especially when using it with a friend. Once random Bible verses have been generated, you can read out one of the verses to see if your partner can recite the Bible passage. You can also do the opposite and read the Bible passage and see if your partner can tell you the verse. The more you study the Bible together in the way, the better acquainted you'll become with all of the Bible verses in the Holy Book.</td>
