    <p class="p1">It happens to us all. You wake up and you're hungry but you're just not in the mood for the breakfast you've had the past week. You want something different, but as you look in your refrigerator and cupboards, there doesn't seem to be anything that's appealing. You want something new but you have no idea what that new is. By looking at pictures of different breakfast ideas, you're sure to come across a bunch of new ideas that you have never before considered. Hopefully, a few of those will sound appealing and you have been inspired to try something new for breakfast. It's also great to look through all the random breakfast ideas the night before so you can be inspired and choose your breakfast for the next morning.</p>
    <p class="p2">Don't limit yourself to just the generated hashtags. These hashtags should be looked at as inspiration so you can create the best wedding hashtag possible for your specific event. You should look at what's generated, then take the best ideas from them. By incorporating the parts you like best from a variety of hashtags the generator produces, you should be able to create the perfect wedding hashtag for your special event.</p>
    <p class="p3">Using a motivational quote that speaks to you is a great way to start a journal page or begin your writing for the day. Just having that first quote to get the ideas going is an invaluable tool - you never know where that one idea will take you. In addition, sometimes writers tend to pick a quote or subject that they're more familiar with. Since you wonâ€™t know what the inspirational quote will be or who the author is beforehand, it may force you to be more creative and think in a new direction about the idea.</p>
